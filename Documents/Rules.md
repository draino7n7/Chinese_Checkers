# RULES
## Object of the Game
Be the first player to move all pieces from the starting area to home area.  A player’s starting area is the triangle in front of the player.  The home area is triangle directly across from the player’s starting area.
## Number of Players
This game will be designed to player 2 players, 3 players, 4 players, and 6 players.
## Starting Positions
In 2 player games, each player will have 15 pieces.  In 3, 4, and 6 player games, each player will have 10 pieces.
In 2, 4, and 6 player games, players will be across from an opponent.  In 3 player games, each player will not be across from an opponent.
Each player’s starting pieces will start in the starting triangle in front each player.
## Turns
Player 1 will always go first.  Play will proceed clockwise.
For each player’s turn, the player must make one and only one move.
There are two types of moves.  
### Move Type 1 – Single Space Move
A player may move one of their pieces to an adjacent empty space.
### Move Type 2 – Jump Move
A player may move one of their pieces by jumping over an adjacent piece.  For this to be possible, the space on the opposite side of the adjacent piece must be empty.  This jump can be chained with more jumps if the landing space has a different adjacent piece available for jumping.  The player cannot jump 2 pieces in one jump.  Each jump must be in a straight line.  The player can jump over any player’s pieces.
### Move restrictions
Once a piece has moved out of its starting area, it cannot move back into the starting area.
Except for a player’s home area, a player cannot move into another starting area (whether a player started in that starting area or not). 
## Winning
The player to move all pieces to their home area (oppodsite side of the board) is the winner.

As a special rule to prevent infinite games, there will be draws.  If at the start of a player's turn, the pieces on the board are in the same position as they have been on two previous starts to that player’s turn (not necessarily consecutive turns), the game will be considered drawn.
